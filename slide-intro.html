					<h2>What is a nuke?</h2>
					<p>
						A nuclear weapon, commonly referred to as a nuke, is an immensely powerful explosive device that derives its destructive force from the release of energy during a nuclear reaction. It involves a process called nuclear fission or fusion, where the atomic nuclei of certain heavy elements are split or merged, resulting in an intense release of energy. This energy is unleashed in the form of a catastrophic explosion, producing an enormous blast wave, intense heat, and a deadly radiation pulse. Nukes are capable of causing widespread devastation, emitting a mushroom cloud that can level entire cities, leaving behind profound destruction and long-term environmental contamination. Due to their immense destructive power, nuclear weapons are considered the most deadly and catastrophic weapons ever created, leading to global efforts aimed at nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.

					<h2>What is openhimer?</h2>
					<p>
						Oppenheimer also known as the manhattan project was the project that created nuclear weapons. There was a committee made by US president Franklin Roosevelt to authorize the creation of atomic bombs. The manhattan project started when a letter came to Roosevelt from Albert Einstein and J. Rober Oppenhiemer saying that the naziz have probably started the work on a nuclear of their own, and that america should start to. The first atomic bombs were test on japan cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
