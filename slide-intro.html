					<h2>What is a nuke?</h2>
					<p>
						A nuke is an explosive device deriving its force from a nuclear reaction, which split or merge heavy atomic nuclei, releasing massive energy in a catastrophic explosion. It causes blast waves, intense heat, deadly radiation, and long-lasting environmental contamination. Nuclear weapons are considered the deadliest and most catastrophic ever, leading to global efforts to disarm and prevent their spread.

					<h2>What is openhimer?</h2>
					<p>
						Oppenheimer also known as the manhattan project was the project that created nuclear weapons. There was a committee made by US president Franklin Roosevelt to authorize the creation of atomic bombs. The manhattan project started when a letter came to Roosevelt from Albert Einstein and J. Rober Oppenhiemer saying that the naziz have probably started the work on a nuclear of their own, and that america should start to. The first atomic bombs were test on japan cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
