					<h2>>The aftermath.</h2>
					<p>
						 After the second atomic bomb was dropped, Japan surrendered and left a large mess to clean up throughout the Pacific theater. To help aid in the process, the United States set up a form of government in Hiroshima to help rebuild the city and give jobs to the people who were struggling to find work. This also allowed for the Red Cross to come in and start to treat the wounded but for many of them it was too late and they were slowly dying with little to no hope for them. Hospitals surpassed occupancy levels and people were tended in the streets where they had fallen when the bomb dropped. People also became test subjects for American doctors and scientists who flocked by the hundreds to observe the effects of the radiation on the Japanese citizens. “American Army doctors flocked by the dozens to observe him. Japanese experts questioned him.”[5] Hiroshima became one large research facility. Not only was it used for research it was also a relief point for Japan and other Asian countries that needed help.
